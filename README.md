# Exploratory_Data_Analysis
# Problem_Statement:

The problem is to analyze and understand road traffic accidents using the
provided dataset. The goal is to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns,
factors, and trends that contribute to accidents and their severity. By gaining insights from the
data, the project aims to formulate evidence-based recommendations to enhance road safety and
reduce the number of accidents and casualties.

# Project_Objective:

The primary objective of the project is to conduct an EDA on the road traffic accidents dataset
and extract meaningful insights. The specific objectives are as follows:
Identify key risk factors: Determine the demographic and driving-related factors that are
associated with a higher likelihood of accidents.
1. Assess accident severity: Analyze the casualty severity and factors influencing the outcome of
accidents.
2. Investigate vehicle defects: Examine the role of vehicle defects in contributing to accidents.
3 .Explore road conditions: Understand the impact of road surface types and conditions on
accident occurrence.
4. Analyze light and weather conditions: Investigate how light and weather conditions affect
accident rates.
5.Examine collision types and vehicle movement: Study the types of collisions and vehicle
movements leading to accidents.
6. Determine common accident causes: Identify the most frequent causes of accidents in the
dataset.


# Project_Overview:
The project will involve the following steps

1. Data Collection: Obtain the road traffic accidents dataset containing various attributes related
to accidents, drivers, vehicles, road conditions, casualties, and more.
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and
converting data into appropriate formats.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct a comprehensive EDA to analyze the distribution
and relationships between different variables. Visualizations, descriptive statistics, and
correlation analysis will be utilized to gain insights into accident patterns.
4. Key Findings: Summarize and interpret the key findings from the EDA, highlighting the
significant factors contributing to accidents and their severity.
5. Recommendations: Based on the analysis, formulate evidence-based recommendations and
strategies to improve road safety and mitigate the identified risk factors.
6. Conclusion: Sum up the results and emphasize the importance of data-driven decisionmaking in enhancing road safety.
7. By performing this EDA, the project aims to provide valuable insights to relevant
stakeholders, such as transportation authorities, policymakers, and law enforcement, to take
proactive measures in reducing road accidents and making roads safer for everyone.
