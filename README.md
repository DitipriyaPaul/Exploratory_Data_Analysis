# Exploratory_Data_Analysis
##Problem Statement:
The problem is to analyze and understand road traffic accidents using the
provided dataset. The goal is to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns,
factors, and trends that contribute to accidents and their severity. By gaining insights from the
data, the project aims to formulate evidence-based recommendations to enhance road safety and
reduce the number of accidents and casualties.
###Project Objective:-
The primary objective of the project is to conduct an EDA on the road traffic accidents dataset
and extract meaningful insights. The specific objectives are as follows:
Identify key risk factors: Determine the demographic and driving-related factors that are
associated with a higher likelihood of accidents.
1. Assess accident severity: Analyze the casualty severity and factors influencing the outcome of
accidents.
2. Investigate vehicle defects: Examine the role of vehicle defects in contributing to accidents.
3 .Explore road conditions: Understand the impact of road surface types and conditions on
accident occurrence.
4. Analyze light and weather conditions: Investigate how light and weather conditions affect
accident rates.
5.Examine collision types and vehicle movement: Study the types of collisions and vehicle
movements leading to accidents.
6. Determine common accident causes: Identify the most frequent causes of accidents in the
dataset.
Project Overview:
The project will involve the following steps
